# medical-literacy-911-app

A prototype for an emergency 911 app that would allow users to navigate a series of easy yes/no questions to get in touch with the local emergency service. The problem today is that most people do not know when it is appropriate to dial 911, or refrain from doing so due to costs, and this often results in dire circumstances. 

This prototype was developed using Xcode, and contains only front-end functionality.
